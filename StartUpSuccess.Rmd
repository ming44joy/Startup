## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Introduction



```{r load_library}
library(readxl) # Read excel files
library(ggplot2) # Visualizations
library(dplyr) # Data manipulation 
library(corrplot) # Correlation matrices
library(caret) # Machine learning 
library(lubridate) # Dates and times
```

## Reading Excel files

```{r read_xl}
start_up <- read_excel("StartupDataCleanedR")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
