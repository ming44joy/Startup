## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Introduction


```{r load_library}
library(readxl) # Read excel files
library(ggplot2) # Visualizations
library(dplyr) # Data manipulation 
library(corrplot) # Correlation matrices
library(caret) # Machine learning 
library(lubridate) # Dates and times
library(skimr)  # An automated EDA tool
```

## Reading Excel files

```{r read_start_up}
start_up <- read_excel("StartupDataCleanedR.xlsx")
```

## Data Prep

Stats on age of company at sale or close? funding amount? funding rounds? 

```{r summary}
summary(start_up)
str(start_up)
skim(start_up)
```


```{r convert}
# This creates a vector for the binary variables
binary_vars <- c("labels", "is_CA", "is_NY", "is_MA", "is_TX", "is_otherstate", "is_software", "is_web", "is_mobile", "is_enterprise", "is_advertising", "is_gamesvideo", "is_ecommerce", "is_biotech", "is_consulting", "is_othercategory", "is_top500", "is_acquired", "is_closed")

# This changes binary_vars to factors
start_up[binary_vars] <- lapply(start_up[binary_vars], as.factor)

# Convert founded_year to integer
start_up$founded_year <- as.integer(start_up$founded_year)

# Drop state_code.1. "Nearly" duplicate of state_code. It's identical with the exception of one missing value. 
start_up <- start_up[, !names(start_up) %in%
                       "state_code.1"]
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

What is the distribution and concentration of start-ups across different states?

```{r state_counts}
state_counts <- apply(start_up[, c("is_CA", "is_NY", "is_MA", "is_TX", "is_otherstate")], 2, function(x) sum(x == 1))

state_data <- data.frame(State = c("California", "New York", "Massachusetts", "Texas", "Other"), Count = state_counts)

ggplot(state_data, aes(x = State, y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blueviolet", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Start-ups Across Different States",
       x = "State", y = "Number of Start-ups") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("is_CA" = "California",
                              "is_NY" = "New York",
                              "is_MA" = "Massachusetts",
                              "is_TX" = "Texas",
                              "is_otherstate" = "Other")) 

state_data$Proportion <- state_data$Count / sum(state_data$Count)

state_data

```

What is the distribution and concentration of start-ups across different categories?

```{r category_counts}
category_counts <- apply(start_up[, c(29:38)], 2, function(x) sum(x == 1))

category_data <- data.frame(Category = c("Software", "Web", "Mobile", "Enterprise", "Advertising", "Games & Video", "E-Commerce", "Biotech", "Consulting", "Other"), Count = category_counts)

ggplot(category_data, aes(x = Category, y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blueviolet", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Start-ups Across Categories",
       x = "Category", y = "Number of Start-ups") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("is_software" = "Software",
                              "is_web" = "Web",
                              "is_mobile" = "Mobile",
                              "is_enterprise" = "Enterprise",
                              "is_advertising" = "Advertising",
                              "is_gamesvideo" = "Games & Video",
                              "is_ecommerce" = "E-Commerce",
                              "is_biotech" = "Biotech",
                              "is_consulting" = "Consulting",
                              "is_othercategory" = "Other")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

category_data$Proportion <- category_data$Count / sum(category_data$Count)

category_data
```

Are there any relationships between funding amount and start-up success?

```{r corr_funding}
start_up$is_acquired_num <- as.numeric(as.factor(start_up$is_acquired))
corr_funding <- cor.test(start_up$funding_total_usd, start_up$is_acquired_num)

corr_funding
```
> Correlation is not statistically significant. P-value is 0.22, which is higher than 0.05, meaning funding is not significant in outcome status (acquired/closed). There doesn't appear to be a linear relationship between funding and start-up success (acquired). **There is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the true correlation is equal to 0. 

Are there any relationships between top 500 and start-up success?

```{r corr_top500}
start_up$is_top500_num <- as.numeric(as.factor(start_up$is_top500))
corr_top500 <- cor(start_up$is_acquired_num, start_up$is_top500_num)

corr_top500
```
> Correlation coefficient of 0.3106518 indicates a moderate positive correlation between top 500 and acquired. This suggests that start-up companies listed in the top 500 companies are more likely to be acquired. This does not mean causation.
